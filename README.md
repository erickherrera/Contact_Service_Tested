## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
### Ensuring user error handling is being implemented before the creation of any invalid object in the programm. Also creating separate unit tests for each of the methods and functions added to the code base, in this case I used JUnit since it is a free open source trsting framework for Java.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
### Write specific unit tests for customer requirements, this will ensure the customer requirements are in fact being met before the customer is even able to perform acceptance training. 

## How do I approach designing software?
### I approach desgining software by also taking into account unit testing specially for the more critical components of the software because even if I am not developing a program for an industry, thinking about testing my own design approach can reduce the amount of time I am looking for solutions to an issue that could become a lot more clear with some test cases around them.
